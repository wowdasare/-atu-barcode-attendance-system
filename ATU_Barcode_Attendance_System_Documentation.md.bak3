## 11. Troubleshooting

### 11.1 Common Issues and Solutions

#### 11.1.1 Database Connection Issues
Problem:: Database connection errors
Solution::
```bash
# Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Test database connection
python manage.py dbshell

# Run migrations if needed
python manage.py migrate
```

#### 11.1.2 QR Code Generation Issues
Problem:: QR codes not displaying
Solution::
```python
# Check QR code dependencies
pip install qrcode[pil] Pillow

# Verify media settings
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

# Check file permissions
chmod 755 media/barcodes/
```

#### 11.1.3 Authentication Problems
Problem:: Users cannot login
Solution::
```bash
# Create admin user
python manage.py create_admin

# Reset user password
python manage.py changepassword username

# Check user permissions
python manage.py shell
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> user = User.objects.get(username='admin')
>>> user.is_active = True
>>> user.save()
```

#### 11.1.4 Static Files Issues
Problem:: CSS/JS files not loading
Solution::
```bash
# Collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic --clear

# Check static files settings
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

# Verify WhiteNoise middleware
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    ...
]
```

### 11.2 Performance Optimization

#### 11.2.1 Database Optimization
```python
# Add database indexes
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(fields=['student_id']),
        models.Index(fields=['barcode_id']),
        models.Index(fields=['session_id', 'student_id']),
    ]

# Use select_related for foreign keys
students = Student.objects.select_related('course').all()

# Use prefetch_related for many-to-many
courses = Course.objects.prefetch_related('students').all()
```

#### 11.2.2 Caching
```python
# Add caching for frequently accessed data
from django.core.cache import cache

def get_student_count():
    count = cache.get('student_count')
    if count is None:
        count = Student.objects.count()
        cache.set('student_count', count, 300)  # 5 minutes
    return count
```

### 11.3 Error Logging

#### 11.3.1 Configure Logging
```python
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'file': {
            'level': 'ERROR',
            'class': 'logging.FileHandler',
            'filename': 'error.log',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django': {
            'handlers': ['file'],
            'level': 'ERROR',
            'propagate': True,
        },
    },
}
```

#### 11.3.2 Monitor Application Health
```python
# Health check endpoint
def health_check(request):
    try:
        # Check database connection
        from django.db import connection
        connection.ensure_connection()
        
        # Check essential services
        student_count = Student.objects.count()
        
        return JsonResponse({
            'status': 'healthy',
            'database': 'connected',
            'students': student_count
        })
    except Exception as e:
        return JsonResponse({
            'status': 'unhealthy',
            'error': str(e)
        }, status=500)
```
